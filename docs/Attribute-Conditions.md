# Attribute Conditions #

[TOC]

------------------


> THIS WORK IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## What is it ##
Attribute condition is a logical expression on the value of an attribute. 

## What is it not ##
The conditions is not meant to:

 * Compare attributes from different packets
 * Compare different attributes of the same packet

## Use Case ##
Attribute conditions are mainly designed to work with attribute handlers. The user indicates the condition to be met in order to call its handler. 

```
   Example: 
   The user wants its attribute handler registered with HTTP.Host be called only when the hostname is "abc.def.com". 
```

## Examples ##
```c
   IP.SRC == 192.168.1.1

   IP.SRC in 192.168.1.0/24

   TCP.SRC_PORT >= 80 AND <= 1024

   TCP.SRC_PORT NOT in 100:200

   HTTP.USER_AGENT contains "android"

   HTTP.HOST_NAME contains "pipo"

   HTTP.HOST_NAME == "montimage.com"

   IP.PROTO_ID == 6

   IP.PROTO_ID == TCP

   ETH.SRC == 00:00:00:00:00:00
   
```
