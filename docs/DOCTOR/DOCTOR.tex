\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )


% correct bad hyphenation here

\section{Monitoring challenges in NDN network}
\subsection{Subsection Heading Here}
Will be written by Wissam

\section{MMT for NDN protocol}
\subsection{Extracting meta data of NDN packet}
MMT provides deep insight on your network by classifying more than 2600 applications and protocols, by collecting your business events, performing statistics and reporting them based on customizable reports and graphs. NDN protocol is also in the list protocols which can be classified, analysed and extracted metadata by MMT. When there is a NDN packet comming, MMT will classifies and extracts the meta data of the packet based on the NDN packet format specification.
\subsubsection{NDN packet format specification \cite{ndn_packet_format}}
The NDN packet is encoded in a Type-Length-Value (TLV) format. Type (T) presents for the type of data. Length (L) presents for the length of data. Value (V) presents for the value of data. All the NDN data types are presented in offical documentation about NDN protocol\cite{ndn_type_value}

Based on the TLV format and the list of NDN data types, MMT will classify, analyses and extracts meta data of NDN packets.

\subsubsection{NDN packet classification}

NDN protocol can be over Ethernet or TCP. MMT classifies NDN packet by analysing the Ethernet data or TCP data of packet. A packet will be classified as a NDN packet if its Ethernet data or TCP data satifies those conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Type of packet: There are 2 types of NDN packet which are distinguished by the type value in the first and outmost TLV$_0$ . Interest packet type is assigned as 05 and Data packet type is assigned as 06.
  \item Length of paket: By extracting the length of NDN packet and compare with the length of Ethernet data or TCP data of packet
  \item Name of packet: Name is the common field of every NDN packet and its type value is assigned as 07
\end{itemize}

It is possible to use more conditions to classify NDN packet by deeper analysing the packet.

\subsubsection{Name}
NDN Name is a common field of NDN packet. Its type value is assigned as 07. It is a hierarchical name for NDN content, which contains a sequence of name components.
\fbox{
  \parbox{\textwidth}{
    Name ::= NAME-TYPE TLV-LENGTH NameComponent*

    NameComponent ::= GenericNameComponent |
                      ImplicitSha256DigestComponent

    GenericNameComponent ::= NAME-COMPONENT-TYPE TLV-LENGTH BYTE*

    ImplicitSha256DigestComponent ::= IMPLICIT-SHA256-DIGEST-COMPONENT-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=32)
                                        BYTE{32}
  }
}

\subsubsection{Interest packet}
A NDN Interest packet is a NDN packet with the first type value is 05. The NDN interest packet is a TLV defined as follows:

Interest ::= INTEREST-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
               Name
               Selectors?
               Nonce
               InterestLifetime?

Name and Nonce are the two required elements in an Interest packet.

\subsubsection{Data packet}
A NDN data packet is a NDN packet with the first type value is 06. The NDN data packet is a TLV defined as follows:

Data ::= DATA-TLV TLV-LENGTH
           Name
           MetaInfo
           Content
           Signature

\subsection{Metrics and KPI}
By extracting and analysing meta data of NDN packet, MMT can provide many kind of metrics such as: number of NDN data volume, number of NDN packets, number of NDN interest packet, number of NDN data packets, ... and also based on meta data of NDN packet, MMT can calculate key performance of NDN protocol. MMT will be a very useful tool for monitoring, testing and developing NDN protocol standard.
\subsubsection{Metrics}

NDN bandwidth: In/out of data volume/number of packet

Incoming Interest packets: data volume/ number of packet
Outgoing Interest packets: data volume/ number of packet
Incoming Data packets: data volume/ number of packet 
Outgoing Data packets: data volume/ number of packet

Name hierarchy tree: Interest traffic, Data traffic, NDN traffic

- Response time for a request: first Interest packet sent to the Data packet responsed: concern about the InterestLifetime

- How many IP / per DP
out of order and retransmission packets

# Special for HTTP-NDN projects
- List of all Gatway
- List of all host/ server
- Reconstruct the body of HTTP request and HTTP response

# QUESTION



\subsubsection{Key performance}

1. evaluate the time it takes to synchronize content over different topologies and different scales using the NDN protocol

2. Evaluate response time in following test case:

a. - First request to data X -> The data will be sent from Server

b. - Second request: request for the same data X -> The data will be sent from Content Store

c. - Other machine in the same network asking for the data X -> The data will be sent from Content Store (not from server)

d. - Make another request for data X after a few time (> lifetime): The data was cached in Content Store maybe has removed and the data will be sent from Server

In c. if we have MMT monitoring network traffic go outside of local network, we will not see NDN packet


3. Evaluate the response time of an NDN request:

- 2 machine in the same network

- machine A request data from machine B

- MMT will be installed on both machine

- A MMT-Operator will collect the information from both machine and make the calculation of the response time


\subsection{MMT implemented}

TBD ... list all of NDN attributes

\section{Future development for security}

Will be written by Wissam

1. Detect hijacks attack by checking the packet signature (All NDN data packets are signed) --> Simulate attack on signature

2. Detect poisoning attack: notify when cached the bad Data packet. (what is the bad data packet????? Is it possible to simulate the attack)


\subsection{Kind of attack on NDN protocol}

1. Interest Flooding attack: One can send Interest packets with different names under the same prefix, causing network congestion and exhaust resources on routers

2. content poisoning attacks: One can send bad data packet to other
